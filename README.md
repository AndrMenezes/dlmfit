# `dlmfit`: Bayesian Dynamic Linear Models

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `dlmfit` is to provide tools for fitting univariate Bayesian
Dynamic Linear Models following the paradigm of [West and Harrison
(1997)](https://www.amazon.com.br/Bayesian-Forecasting-Dynamic-Models-Mike/dp/0387947256).

## Installation

You can install the development version of `dlmfit` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/AndrMenezes/dlmfit) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("AndrMenezes/dlmfit")
```

## Other packages

The dlmfit is an experiment write based on a course that I have in first
semester of 2020. There are other R packages more robust to fit Dynamic
Linear Model or also known State Space Models, see [Durbin and Koopman
(2001)](https://www.amazon.com.br/Time-Analysis-State-Space-Methods/dp/019964117X).
